Analysis
	I need to make a program that will count the number of occurances of a chosen letter in a sentence.

Specs

	input- sentence
	input- chosen letter
	output- number of occurances of letter

Design
	def main()
	print("...msg introducing program")
	prompt for a sentence, name input 'message'
	prompt for a letter, name input 'letter'
	total =sentence.count(chosen)
	main()

Code
	#lettercounter.py
	#This program reports the number of times a certain letter appears in a sentence.
	#By Ashley Cook

	def main():

	    print("This program reports the number of times a chosen letter appears in a sentence.\n")
	    #Prompt for sentence and letter
	    sentence = input("Enter input sentence:" )
	    chosen = input("Enter input letter:" )
	    total = sentence.count(chosen)

	 
		print("Number occurrences of the letter", chosen , ":" , total)

	main()

Debugging
	This code works, but I need it to report both uppercase and lowercase. I guessed I would need to include chosen.lower and chosen.upper, but
	I had to try different things before it could work. First I tried:

	upper = sentence.count(chosen.upper)
    lower = sentence.count(chosen.lower)
    total = (upper + lower)

    This resulted in errors.

    I also tried using length, len(sentence.count(chosen)) but that did not make sense. 

    After messing around with the code and thinking about how the functions actually worked, I resulted in this:

Final Code

	#lettercounter.py
	#This program reports the number of times a certain letter appears in a sentence.
	#By Ashley Cook

	def main():

	    print("This program reports the number of times a chosen letter appears in a sentence.\n")
	    #Prompt for sentence and letter
	    sentence = input("Enter input sentence:" )
	    chosen = input("Enter input letter:" )

	 

	    upper = sentence.lower().count(chosen)
	    lower = sentence.upper().count(chosen)
	    total = (upper + lower)
	  
	   

	    print("Number occurrences of the letter", chosen , ":" , total)

	main()
